# A-Machine-Learning-Based-Fraud-Detection-System
The preprocessing step converts categorical features (location, device_type) into numeric values using Label Encoding, ensuring consistency across train and test sets. It then separates features (X) from the target label (is_fraud) and removes non-predictive IDs, preparing clean data for model training.
